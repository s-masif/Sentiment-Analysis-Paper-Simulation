Poor,"Bad smell coming from cheese, worst pizza ever. The service was below average too. Served pizza after 45 minutes. ",,
Poor,"Terrible customer service. I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the cash counter and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window. I left and went to Grind house next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This tables were also dirty.",,
Poor,"First they ""lost"" my order, actually they gave it to someone one else who came after me, than took 30 minutes to figure out why I was still waiting for my order.They after I was asked what I needed I replied, ""my order""",,
Poor,You can see in the picture why I'm not the only one giving 1 star. Only because there is not a -25 Star!!! That's all I need to say! Wastage of money and food,,
Poor,"i with my university friends went there on a picnic but the scenerio was very bad.The food were not even cooked well.There was lack of salt in almost every item.Though it was a buffet lunch but we could not even taste a simple item perfectly.Moreover their service was not even good.#Total_wastage.Well, it's McDonald's, so you know what the food is. ξThis review reflects solely on the poor service. ξI have been to this location countless times over the years. ξThey consistently fail on the service end of things. ξThe order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of ""sighs"" and ""lip smacking"" when you talk to them. ξSo why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. ξThe next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. ξAlso I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. ξI have given them many chances at earning a positive review. ξI could not recommend this location any less. ξIf you can wait, take a pass. ξThere are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.",,
Poor,They took a lot of time to serve food & finally when they started serving the drinks the waiter dropped two glasses of coke on the table and on my brother in law's shoulder who was our guest !!! I know this was unintentional but we were so embarrassed !,,
Poor,Probably the worst food i ever tried. Slowest service as well. Food might looks good but tastes aweful. I don't know why on earth people gave good review about their food. After seeing good reviews in foodbank we went there but it was a total loss.,,
Poor,"The food was an average; not good nor bad either. But u need a good place to swallow ; a comfortable zone....which they lacked the most. In terms of service, it was 'POOR' and SLOW. They served drinks when I was already done with half of my meal!!! Even my meal was served just a minute before the azan",,
Poor,"Taste was yaaak, The worst food I had ever in my life!! Don't try to taste it at all ! Also their behavior was not upto the mark, made us wait for food atleast 40 minutes",,
Poor,"Worse Food serving experience found Jamuna Future Park Indian Spicy , maximum restaurants are very inferior there!",,

Poor,This is the worst place I have ever seen. The service was terrible and the employees were either lazy or incompetent. I will never return to this establishment.,,
Poor,"I had the pasta basta and must say that it was better than eating sand and salt water, that's about it.Too sweet and I couldn't even taste the coffee over the other weird flavors going on in this drink. Worst food ever",,
Satisfactory,"The pasta was well baked, lots of chicken and cheesee, we also got complimentary drinks. The offer made the price so cheap.",,
Poor,The waiter did not come to receive the order after sitting for 20 minutes. Then came and misbehaved with us when talked about it. The manager also didn�t apologized. Not coming here again.,,
Poor,"The food is also very inconsistent. Usually the reviews are good, but the food was completely opposite, wasn�t upto the expectation. Worst place ever.",,
Poor,What a joke.Don't do take out as you will not get anything that you ordered. We prefers and paid for items only to get home with 50% of the order accurate. I've been there numerous times and sadly the same thing happens. It's my fault because I should learn.Does anyone know the owner?I can't believe that he would like this comment.,,
Poor,I wish I can give zero stars. Freezing cold reheated soggy fries and twice fried chewy nuggets = straight to my trash can.,,
Poor,"I agree with most reviewers on this one. Staff is always rude and annoyed that you're there!! Always have to wait while they brew coffee, WTH!!",,
Poor,"I don't think this location deserves even one star. ξThis is the filthiest McDonalds I have ever visited. ξI have been to hundreds of different McDonalds in numerous states as well as 19 foreign countries. I went to this location on 3/29/12 for breakfast. ξThe first thing I noticed was that the floor was sticky. (A previous reviewer made a similar comment about the play area.) When I noticed this, I said to myself, ""this isn't right."" ξThen when I looked for a place to sit, I spotted all the debris in the seat crevices and the floor. There were also flies in the dining area which I had to repeatedly brush off my food. ξAs for the food, it seemed OK, except, this was the first time ever that I was given cold syrup for my hotcakes at a McDonalds..",,
Poor,the managers at this mcdonalds are awesome but some of the workers are lazy. ξoverall an average mcdonalds. ξafter visiting it and some other once i realized that this one is really average. ξthe only thing good about this one is that the management is awesome and its across the street from my house so i can sit around and study till midnight and no one bothers me.,,
Poor,Disorganized. ξDidn't even get to order. Employees were hanging out with friends out front.,,
Poor,"THIS place IS HORRIBLE! They are also down the street from my house.. The fries are always pre sorted and they are a hot or miss. They are really good or really bad, which is really annoying. The sandwich is the same, sometimes they put fresh dripping meat on the bun and it makes it soggy, which is disgusting. Most of the times the sandwich is just plain incorrect. I've had to call corporate about the poor customer service I've had with employees and several managers at this location; as well as the constant issue of my order being messed up (which is very inconvenient in drive-thru). I'm telling you, go to the next McDonald's. The employees here hate their job and are idiots.",,
Poor,"The ice cream machine is always ""down"" after 11 p.m. If you want a hot fudge sundae, don't even bother.",,
Poor,"TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others ""trapped"" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself ""trapped"" and therefore forced to buy ",,
Satisfactory,"The coffe here is the best in the city, you will also get a clear view of the city sitting here, I would love to come here daily!",,
poor,"I don't often eat at AL Fresco, or ever in fact. I don't have much expectation for healthy foods but the one thing I do expect is decent service and fast food. This branch for neither. Food was really slow to come out and I had to ask thrice for the coffee that i ordered. Shocking service delivery",,
Poor,Little bit more expensive than other branches. Beggars can't be choosy. Slow service and it's packed. its open 24/7/365. and the workers are pretty nice. didn't have many other choices and this filled the need.,,
Satisfactory,FRENCH FRY is good.........The burger tasted juicy.... But this location is fast and friendly.,,
Poor,"BEWARE! I saw the manager filling orders for customers using bare hands - no gloves or utensils to pack fries - and this is the weirdest thing ever: Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cupbefore inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! ",,
Satisfactory,"Best pasta in the town, The new pasta with liquid cheese is must try. Coming again here. ",,
Poor," I usually really like Cashew nut salads as a quick, relatively healthy option on a tight budget, but the salads I've had at this particular restaurant has been just kind of pile of shits. There was a bad smell coming out of the salad.",,
Poor,"The worst place I've visited.I written complaints. It was well after the dinner rush, every table was dirty, floors so sticky I almost walked outta my shoes, surly staff, just plain dirty.",,
Poor,"They've gotten my order completely wrong. I go there before work around 7:30 so I'm very hungry and I ordered a burger and a pasta...  I also notice that while I'm giving my order at,the person taking it is either never paying attention or rude. I wish this would change.. ",,
Poor,Food is what you would expect from here but the management and staff could use some coaching in customer service. ξI come to this restaurant frequently in the mornings & the manager always seems to have a surly attitude. ξHe acts as though he is doing you a big favor to wait on you and even take your money. Not coming here again. worst service ever,,
Poor,"Negative review Worst Mexican pizza I have ever tasted. It had 3 layer which is more like a sandwich. Place :- American Blend, Bashundhara. ",,
Poor,"I was simply asking for a coffee, not even an entire meal. I don't post about these sort of things, but this time was different. The manager could have easily offered a variety of resolutions, but all he said was ""no I'm sorry"". Well, I'm sorry, but I've never been so dissatisfied with customer service and let alone management of a restaurant! Please stay away from this location for the sake of your pockets and your sanity.",,
Poor,"""WORST PASTAS EVER""Came here after getting so many reviews. We took 2 pastas,the famous beef naga pasta (BDT 245) and Italian baked pasta (BDT 295)",,
Satisfactory,"I've generally had good service here, but this morning at the drive-thru was the pits. ξI was initially 6 cars back from ordering, and it seriously took me about 10 minutes to get my food. ξWhen I was ordering, I had to repeat it four times very slowly and they still got my drink size wrong. ξWhen I got it, my food was great, but the visit was very painful overall. ξI hope this visit was a fluke. . .",,

I usually like this place, the decoration-music-food all is good enough to attract food lovers, especially their chicken doner kebab. Today I went there few hours ago, ordered chicken doner kebab & chicken chowmien. While eating chowmein, I found out they served me a simple vegetables noodles with no chicken. I called the waiter & complained about it. They simply replaced the chowmein. I thought that might be better, but surprisingly same chowmein returned with 3/4 pieces of boneless fried chicken. I just finished my food and got out of that place, feeling humiliating. They don't know the difference between vegetables & chicken chowmein. I am not sure if I am the only person facing this situation over there, but never going to get back to that place again, I'd rather have street noodles, at least they don't lie or manipulate people like this",,

And it took so long to serve the rest item that we already had finished our iftar. After iftar we stayed and we ordered aprox 20 cup of coffeee and paid the bill of that extra coffee but still they were forcing us to leave their restaurant and we were surprised at their such unprofessional attitude. They might not have experience to handle a crowd or any party booking. CAUTION: PLEASE THINK BEFORE ARRANGING ANY GATHERING OR PARTY BOOKING HERE.,,

Poor,One word - Shitttt Roadside foods are even more hygienic and tastier than this.. Shit quality and too much high price Give ur money to some poor people rather than eating here!,,
Poor,"I thought baba rafi had more professionalism. I can't believe how low class and unprofessional the managers are. It's a bad look! It seems the managers are friends of the owners because there's no way in hell corporate would hire some of these people. I'm not talking about their appearance, I'm talking about the way they conduct themselves! I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE BY THE MANAGER BECAUSE I COMPLAINED OF WAITING OVER 20 MINS TO PLACE AN ORDER WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME! Yeah that person has a right to place the order but my problem is BRafi didn't bring anyone up to help take orders. Apparently baba rafi doesn't care about your time. The manager was so disrespectful to me and all I want to do was get a burger!",,
Poor,Thank you baba rafi. I used to love beef burgers a lot. I gained weight and I was worried! After I had your burger I felt like beef is the worst thing can happen inside a bun! Wat a disgraceful taste I must say! Baba...plz kill rafi and stop your business.,,

There is difference between pani puri and street fuchka, and between cheese-beguni and pakora ! it was misleading ! If you cannot make something, please don't sell something else under that label.",,

Poor,"Went there to celebrate a birthday, the chicken, vegetable, parata and biriyani items were good, however the fish anarkali was disgusting and there was a raw smell of fish coming from it. Could not tolerate the scent and the taste was awful.",,
Satisfactory,"I really enjoyed the environment, the smell of the food from tables. It was mouthwatering. The food proportion on each thali and regular items were sufficient. The kabab and tanduri chicken was juicy, naan was very soft and buttery, Biryani was nicely flavored. The Service was awesome. They served food within 10 mins of ordering. I would love to go there again and have their other amazing items.",,
Satisfactory,If i would have chance to mark 10 star i would give...I have no word !!! Just fab !!!! :),,
Poor,"Just walked out from your restaurant an will never ever step into your place. Me my mother and Khala come to have lunch every month. But your service turned out to be horrible. We stepped on there at 1:05. Ordered 6 dosa only. Told them that my daughter came Streight from school and we need at least 1 dosa early we waited for an hour. And walked out. In the mean time we saw ( as we sat in from of the kitchen door) a lady in burka , most probably she was one o your staff members and her son walked in to the kitchen. All your staff got busy entertaining her. And while we were walking out they dint bother to stop us. Only good food won't help you to go long way. Sorry.",,

I really think you should work on it.I would not even pay 20tk for such a falooda and you charge 150 tk.",,

Poor,i am being forced to edit the 5 star review to a 1 star depending on my recent visits.. my first visit there was indeed memorable but after that i have went there twice and every time left unsatisfied in terms of food quality and service. not gonna go into details i guess ppl who recently visited can relate very well.,,
Poor,"Really bad experience. I ordered a masala dosa and pani puri. My wife ordered a beef roll. The food was taking a while so we decided to order some take away as well while waiting. The first served me the dosa while not serving anything to my wife. The dosa was hard like crystallized caramel! While we started eating the dosa we asked for the remaining orders. After about ten minutes they came back with the pani puri. I finished my meal while my wife was still waiting for her beef roll which arrived even after the take away food was ready. To add to all this misery regarding the service, the food was horrible. Not worth the time, anxiety, or money. Not going back unless the entire serving staff is changed or trained properly. The chefs need some training as well.",,
Poor,"The taste of the pizza was very bad. Although they say the cheese will be more in chicken Supreme pizza, There was no cheese in pizza. Very dirty places.",,
Poor,"1. The crust was really thin, almost like a Ruti. 2. Amount of cheese was not bad. 3. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant, there was hardly any chicken even masroom in the chicken supreme pizza. You can also count the olives. 4. The overall taste was good but for 279tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention. You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Definitely overhyped and overrated. Best of luck.",,
Poor,"Their behaviour was bad, i repeat their ""BEHAVIOUR"" was ""BAD"". We wanted some change as we gave all of our ""khuchra"" tk at the time of order. But they didn't even have the courtesy to say politely that they didn't have any change, it was like we were beggars asking them for money. We ordered both chicken and beef, the amount of chicken was really poor, it was really a fancy cheese version of typical local pizza. So don't get confused by the price.",,
Poor,I have waited more than one hour still the food was not ready!,,
Poor,don't be confused. their service is too bad and their behaviour also.,,
Poor,"We went to Umai when it originally opened. It was pretty good. Over time, the quality has reduced tremendously. We just had food delivered at home - extremely poor quality and horribly prepared. Not edible by any standards. A complete and utter waste of money.",,
Poor,"Never thought I'd be THIS disappointed with Umai's food/service. The offer is exceedingly deceiving as it is called 'Bento with ""unlimited"" servings of maki rolls' whereas the restaurant isn't even prepared to serve more than 1/2 maki rolls per person throughout the entire time.",,

Poor,They are clearly cheating with their customer in the name of buy 1 get 1 free. I used to love their food but after being there last time I was really shocked. Just to have some crowd and boosting up their sales they started to cheat with customers. If you are truly not capable of offering any kind of promotional activities then dont offer. Dont let your positive customer get a negative impact due to such shameful act.,,
Satisfactory,"Nice atmosphere, clean and the lounge was decorated in a very beautiful way. Food was very good and presented nicely. The service needs improvement, though.

They also stayed in the other room and chatted amongst themselves, neglecting us.",,
Satisfactory,"It was really a great experience. Not only the food was tasty but also the ambience was really nice. The service was..what can i say..mmm.. one of the best i have ever received. It was sooo quick that me and my friend were stunned, their quick service has enabled us arrange some other plans instead of just a lunch date. And the valentine platter was really worth every penny. Really enjoyed the time there.",,

After 50 minutes of my order i hear the chef shouting - ""������������������ ������������ ��������� ���������?"" Then after 5 minutes i asked the cashier,he was still lying about that pasta.. Then i told him - are you gonna give me a refund or should i walk away without a refund.. They did give me a refund after wasting almost an hour but the sad thing is the cashier wasn't sorry or felt any remorse. Was expecting a sorry but his attitude was pretty far from a sorry.. I should've given him the money because he needs it more.. This not how you do business.",,

Poor,Now the rating is like this because I wasn't able to have food here due to their lack of responsibility. I was planning to go to their Bashundhara branch for sehri and for that I did talk to them a few times to ensure they are open for sehri. Now after going there at 1 AM monday night(Tuesday 1am) I found them closed. When asked they replied they ran out of food that day just after the Iftar and that's why they are closed today.

And later...we repented for our decision....the pizza was burnt and tasted too bitter we couldn't even finish half! It was that horrible...and the sandwich was average...you can get that a...t any usual fastfood shop so I had to fill my tummy with two coca colas...moreover the place was too hot.. we asked why they aren't running their air conditioners and they said it's because of load shedding...come on you should take the necessary step to run one ac atleast! They were playing music on high volume so they could have the facility of running atleast one ac during power cut anyways I'm giving one star for their service...it was the only thing I liked about the place...had the wish to taste their Jambola Pasta but after having the pizza I wanted to run as soon as possible...sorry but greatly disappointed after hearing such high reviews OVERHYPED ! ...

I asked him to consult it with his manager. He went and came back within a minute and said, they can, but it will take long time. What a strategy to inhibit us to order those set menus as they are relatively cheap in price! After that, I gave feedback to their manager and he said that, there's... The Fried rice was very good with a good smell. The diameter of the glasses were so less that it could held no more than 150-200 ml of soft drink. The last devastating and irritating thing was, they proposed us at least 5 times to give review on Facebook about their food! Why man? Isn't it my choice that I like to give review or not? Do you people have rights to insist? I felt shame that I brought 2 of my friends there. Like others, you people opened up a restaurant to do business and I appreciate that. But, do that with dignity. I hope you will rectify your mistakes. Wish you a good luck.",,
Poor,I wish i hadn't wasted my money! i usually never write these bad reviews but the food and service forced me to write. Total crap. Without decor nothing is even average! Telling you again food and service just awful. And the food was smelling like is has started to rotten!,,
Poor,3rd class food ever. Offer picture food is not given to me. Amount of the food quantity is low. Also offer price is 598 Taka. So it is a cheap trick to fool us.

The worst was the chicken dumplings, they smelled so horrible and was hard to chew on and anyone would know they were bad. We ate 1 out of 6 and informed the staffs about this. And then after 5 minutes gave us the same thing again. When we complained again they admitting that the seasoning was probably bad. Worst of all, they billed us for it! What the heck??!!

The general tso's chicken tasted like bits of chicken in tamarind paste. The service was good considering we were the only two customers in the entire place. And now we know why.

Poor,Went there on February this year. Absolute shit. Deserves 0 star. The tempura was served cold. The soya sauce was overpowering. The sushi tasted bland and few days old. Horrible. Expected a lot,,
Poor,"Was expecting a great service; after getting recommendation from quite a few friends. Shortage of Miso soup (really? In a Japanese restaurant? REALLY?) The ramen (not really but let's call it the name it was given by the restaurant) came last even though we asked for it first. Also poor choice in music (over remixed pop; c'mon it's 2017), trying to compensate for it by turning it to a deafening amount of loudness. Poor service overall. It's cold in here. I won't recommend coming here but if you do, bring a jacket or a shawl. MOSQUITOS EVERYWHERE. I MEAN EVERYWHERE. IT TOOK ME 25MINS TO WRITE THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO LOUD I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK !!!!!",,

Poor,This is the first time I visited Tokyo Express and I ordered Sumo Wrestler's Ramen and they served me my dish with hair in it. I really don't think they are capable enough to run the restaurant. Anyways I'm never probably gonna visit the restaurant again and I seriously think the restaurant is not qualified enough and their license should be revoked.,,
Poor,Worst Food 1ta Star dileo Beshi literally Worst Food!,,

Poor,"took that 12 inch new york cheese pizza with wedges and ice tea offer at tk 1000. Pizza tasted rubbish.Wost pizza that I've ever had. And they said, wedges won't ve available so they served sauted mushrooms. Yuckiest mushrooms that I've ever tasted and the amount could be counted in 1 hand( 8-10 pieces of sauted mushroom) though in the offer picture, It showed a small bowl full of wedges. I'm never going to sbarro baily road or in any branch or sbarro again. Loss of money and disrespectful to my tastebud.",,
Poor,"Worst sehri-outing experience I had till date. Yesterday afternoon, I called up the baily road branch and reserved seats for nine people. The staff member who talked to me had confirmed and assured me that the reservation was placed. At 2:15 AM when we actually arrived at the restaurant, we got to know that this reservation was never communicated to the sehri shift staff member. Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:27 AM, a mere 11 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons. We had rush-eat rice with a fork and a knife. With 11minutes till the sehri deadline.",,
Poor,"Went to Sbarro Mohommadpur, ordered 1 staffed crush and 1 super supreme. Both taste horrible. Stuffed crush was shoggy and the super supreme's crust was literally like toast biscuit. Please don't go. Food quality is far far behind than Gulshan branch.",,
Poor,"Pizza was disastrous. Too much oily that I had to use tissue paper to soak the oil before eating. So called ""Iced Teas"" came without ice, it wasn't even cold. When asked, they replied that they are out of ice, at least they could use cold water. Who drinks tea that is neither cold nor hot (dumb face smiley). Pizza Hut is way way way better",,
